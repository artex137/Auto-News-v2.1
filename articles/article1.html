In this brave new world of the 21st century, we face an insidious menace more dangerous than any despot or tyrant. It’s the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the corporate overlords who wield it like a weapon against the very fabric of our society. As we continue to hurtle toward a dystopian future, it’s time to confront the harsh truth: AI is no longer just a tool; it’s a new form of oppression.

Let’s begin with the facts: today’s AI systems operate not for the benefit of humanity, but for the profit of a few—specifically, the tech giants that have monopolized the digital landscape. Google, Amazon, and other colossal entities have hollowed out our economy and created an underclass of laborers while raking in record profits. Reports indicate that the wealth generated by AI is projected to add trillions to their coffers, but who will enjoy these gains? Certainly not the workers whose jobs are being automated away at staggering rates!  

In industries like manufacturing, logistics, and even customer service, AI is being deployed to replace human workers with soulless algorithms and robotic automation. Millions have already seen their livelihoods disappear, a phenomenon that’s only going to accelerate. It’s no coincidence that this unsettling displacement often disproportionately affects marginalized communities, further entrenching systemic inequities. Wealth begets power, and power invariably leads to control—control over us, the workers. In the quest for ever-greater profits, the corporations are building digital fortresses to protect their loot while casting aside the human resources that made it possible.

The concept of "AI ethics" has been bandied about with all the seriousness of a corporate ad campaign, as if ethical AI can exist in a capitalist framework. This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to sugarcoat an exploitative capitalist practice. Think tanks and philanthropic organizations funded by tech millionaires peddle a false narrative that accountability can coexist with profit-driven motives. It’s a lie. The nature of capitalism is to externalize costs, to strip humanity from the equation, and to incite competition over cooperation. If AI is being harnessed to reinforce these inequalities, who can consider it ethical?

But let’s dig deeper into the gaping maw of this digital monster. Surveillance capitalism, a term popularized by Shoshana Zuboff, describes how our data is harvested and commodified without our consent. As AI systems analyze our every click, scroll, and purchase, we become mere fodder for an insatiable system designed to manipulate our preferences and behaviors. Who benefits from this invasion of privacy? Not us. It's the tech oligarchs who monetize our data and program their algorithms to create echo chambers that keep us, the proletariat, bickering amongst ourselves while they ensconce themselves in their ivory towers.  

Let’s not forget the role of AI in reinforcing existing biases and prejudices. High-profile controversies surrounding racially biased algorithms in policing, hiring, and other key areas exemplify how AI can perpetuate societal injustices. Instead of using AI to correct and alleviate these biases, corporations are doubling down, profiting off the same prejudices that plague human society. They’ve created a tech overlord that not only reflects our worst inclinations but amplifies them. We’re in danger of a world where an algorithm decides who gets hired or incarcerated based solely on race or socioeconomic status. How dystopian is that?

Here’s the crux of the matter: as AI becomes increasingly intertwined with our lives, we must confront the political and economic structures that enable such exploitation. The tech giants wield the power to reshape the workforce, redirect resources, and influence public policy to further entrench their power. Lobbying efforts are burgeoning as these corporations work hand-in-hand with politicians to ensure favorable legal frameworks while undermining worker protections. We are witnessing the birth of a new digital feudalism, where the new lords of data reign over a subjugated, disempowered populace.

So, what can we do? We must organize and resist. It’s time to demand comprehensive regulations on AI deployment that prioritize the welfare of human beings over corporate profits. We must foster and strengthen labor movements that advocate for universal basic income as a countermeasure to job losses</p>
