In the modern world, where technology has surpassed the dreams of even the most speculative fiction, we find ourselves on the precipice of a new kind of dehumanization. Artificial Intelligence (AI)—once the hero of our wildest fantasies—has, in its rapid evolution, become a corporate weapon of oppression and exploitation for the richest 1%. With the veil of progress hanging before us, we must confront the harsh truth: AI ethics is often a smokescreen, obscuring the malevolent intentions of those who wield this technology.

Imagine a world where every click you make, every purchase, and every shot of joy you experience is meticulously recorded and fed into a giant algorithm, designed not to serve you but to profit off you. This is the reality we face as tech giants—under the guise of innovation—employ AI to surveil our lives, manipulate our behaviors, and maintain their stranglehold on power. No longer constrained by the lack of human oversight, these algorithms evolve with a speed that leaves ethical considerations gasping for breath.

But let's dig deeper. What does this mean for workers, for the everyday people who toil and sweat only to see their jobs threatened by these lifeless foes? Automation, bolstered by AI, steadily replaces human workers in vast sectors—warehouses, customer service, and even journalism. The “industry of the future” is simply a euphemism for a crisis of massive unemployment, but corporate executives throw around catchy phrases like “upskilling” as they rake in profits while throwing their employees to the wolves.

 

As corporations continue to automate tasks, they present the misguided argument that AI will free us from mundane labor, allowing humans to pursue more “creative” endeavors. This platitude, far from being liberating, perpetuates a capitalist cycle of inequality. Those who can afford expensive education and training will thrive, while the working class is left to languish in a world of broken dreams and entitlement.

Now, don’t be misled into believing that AI is inherently malevolent; it is the way it is deployed that is most troubling. At the core of AI, we find algorithms driven by data that reflects existing societal biases—from gender discrimination to racial profiling. When these biases are encoded into AI systems, they do not just replicate existing inequalities; they amplify them, turning our world into a dystopian nightmare. Think of how facial recognition technology disproportionately targets communities of color, while surveillance systems elevate white supremacy under the guise of “safety.” This isn’t just a glitch; it’s a feature.

The laughably named “AI Ethics Boards” of these corporations often amount to little more than PR stunts designed to deflect criticism. Beneath these flimsy façades, real accountability is nowhere to be found, especially when it comes to giant tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta. These entities underpin their product launches with grand promises about ethics in AI while tirelessly lobbying against any semblance of regulation. They do not want to be held accountable; they want to push boundaries until someone else picks up the pieces.

 

The question remains: Who benefits from this technology? Certainly not the working class who hands over their data while being treated like disposable commodities. It is those wealthy shareholders and executives who devise policies in secluded boardrooms, perpetuating the cycle of mechanized control. The very essence of our humanity is being bartered away—all under the pretense that this intricate web of algorithms is a gift to society. In reality, it is a deception.

So what can we do?

The first step is awakening to this reality. Workers, activists, and ethically-minded technologists need to unite and demand that technological advancement never comes at the cost of humanity. We must advocate for transparency, pushing for regulations that ensure ethical considerations take precedence over profit margins. If AI must exist, it should serve us— the many—not the few.

In this battle, we must also utilize our political voices to fight for legislation that safeguards our rights against unwarranted surveillance and exploitation. Imagine harnessing the power of AI not to control, but rather to uplift. Let’s create systems that benefit everyone, enforcing ethical use through worker and community representation on boards that currently prioritize profit-driven agendas.
